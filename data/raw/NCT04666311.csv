NCT04666311,Diagnostic Accuracy of CAD4TB and C-reactive Protein Assay as Triage Tests for Pulmonary Tuberculosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04666311,TB TRIAGE+,COMPLETED,"In the TB TRIAGE+ ACCURACY study, the accuracy of the following products will be determined:

* CAD4TB (Delft Imaging System, NL), a digital chest x-ray analysis software
* Afinion CRP assay (Alere Afinion, USA), which detects a cytokine induced acute phase protein

CAD4TB and the C-reactive protein assay are two tests with great potential of becoming a triage test for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). These potential triage tests for TB are intended to serve as rule-out tests with a high sensitivity and negative predictive value.

Before impact and cost-effectiveness of new TB triage tests for intensified active case finding can be determined, the diagnostic test accuracy needs to be assessed in comparison to confirmatory reference tests. This accuracy study will define cut-off values for CAD4TB as well as for the Afinion CRP assay to be used in a future cluster-randomised trial on impact and cost-effectiveness of TB triage strategies for intensified active case finding in Lesotho and KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

A sub-study (detailed in a separate study protocol), hereafter called AHD-FEASIBILITY, explores the feasibility of implementing a series of point-of-care tests, including the new VISITECT CD4 Advanced Disease Test (Omega Diagnostics, UK) as part of the WHO-recommended advanced HIV Disease care package in the context of community-based HIV/TB campaigns.

Due to the coinciding pandemics and the overlapping symptoms of TB and COVID-19, it is critical to test for SARS-Cov-2 infections in the study population. In addition, this study will contribute to the evaluation of a novel SARS-Cov-2 antigen rapid diagnostic test (from the diagnostic pipeline of FIND) and CAD4COVID, a digital chest x-ray analysis software (Delft Imaging System, NL) in combination with differential white blood cell count.",NO,Pulmonary Tuberculosis|Tuberculosis Diagnosis|Covid-19|HIV,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Accuracy of CAD4TB and Afinion CRP assay for pulmonary TB|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: CAD4COVID+WBC and COVID-19 RDT for SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Determine CAD4TB cut-off value, Receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC) of CAD4TB against a composite microbiological reference standard (mycobacterial culture \[MGIT\] or Xpert MTB/RIF) to define an acceptable diagnostic cut-off value., 15 months after first patient visit|Determine Afinion CRP assay cut-off value, Receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC) of Afinion CRP assay against a composite microbiological reference standard (mycobacterial culture \[MGIT\] or Xpert MTB/RIF) to define an acceptable diagnostic cut-off value., 15 months after first patient visit","Evaluate CAD4TB ROC against reference standard, Receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC) of CAD4TB against a single microbiological reference standard (mycobacterial culture \[MGIT\] alone, Xpert MTB/RIF alone, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra alone), against a composite reference standard and against a radiological reference standard, 15 months after first patient visit|Evaluate Afinion CRP assay ROC against reference standard, Receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC) of Afinion CRP assay against a single microbiological reference standard (mycobacterial culture \[MGIT\] alone, Xpert MTB/RIF alone, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra alone) and against a composite reference standard, 15 months after first patient visit|Evaluate CAD4COVID and COVID-19 RDT ROC against reference standard, Receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC) of CAD4COVID combined with differential white blood cell count and point estimates of sensitivity and specificity the novel SARS-Cov-2 antigen rapid diagnostic test, both against a single microbiological reference standard (SARS-Cov-2 real-time PCR), 15 months after first patient visit",,Klaus Reither,"SolidarMed|Human Sciences Research Council|Institute of Tropical Medicine, Belgium|Radboud University Medical Center|Charite University, Berlin, Germany|University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland|Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, Switzerland|European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP)|Ministry of Health, Lesotho",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,1400,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,P1685-20A,2021-02-15,2022-04-05,2022-08-11,2020-12-14,,2025-09-22,"Butha-Buthe District Hospital, Butha-Buthe, Lesotho|Caluza Clinic, Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa",
