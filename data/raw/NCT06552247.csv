NCT06552247,Glaucoma Algorithm Validation Study in African Population - the MAGIC Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06552247,MAGIC,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms require validation in a variety of populations to ensure widespread clinical applicability. In Ophthalmology, AI algorithms are reaching maturity in diagnosis such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. Higher-at-risk subjects of African descent are nevertheless usually under-represented in training datasets and therefore unclear about representativity.

A small scale validation study in consecutive patients in a large Eyesore unit in Mozambique will be performed to determine the diagnostic ability of these AI softwares in this population",NO,Glaucoma|Diabetic Retinopathy,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Fundus Picture AI testing,"Diagnostic agreement between referring decision and reading center decision, Level of agreement will be done between referring decision and the ground truth as assessed by the reading center (normal, glaucoma suspect; definitive glaucoma). All subjects from both centers (referred and non-referred) will be reviewed.

For a primary outcome analysis, the middle category (glaucoma suspect) will be pooled together with the normal diagnosis, Duration of the study - 3 weeks","Level of agreement (in %) between AI-risk score and human-based assessment of disease severity, Reading center risk score of disease severity (ranked from 0 to 100) will be compared to the AI-based disease score. This will be done separately in each of the 3 categories (normal; glaucoma suspect; glaucoma). Analysis of this score would help refine clinical risk (high risk vs low risk patients) of each category. Exploratory analysis will be made to determine the added value of including this risk score in refining AI-based referral, After the study - 6 months",,Centro Hospitalar Universitário Lisboa Norte,Dr. Agarwal's Eye Hospital,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,100,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC,Collaboration Mozambique 2,2024-08-14,2024-08-31,2024-08-31,2024-08-13,,2024-08-13,,
